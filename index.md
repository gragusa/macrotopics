Course Description 
==================
**Topics in Macroeconometrics** aim is to endow students with a working knowledge of the modern econometric methods used in macroeconomics and, to some extent, in finance.

Topics range from classic time series concepts such as linear univariate and multivariate processes (ARMA, VAR) to techniques that have only recently entered the applied macroeconomist' toolbox (Bayesian VAR and Factor Models).

Students need to be familiar with econometric theory at the level of Advanced Econometrics (246PP).

Texbook and Readings 
====================

The main references for this courses are:

-   Brockwell, Peter J. and Richard A. Davis, *Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting*, Springer, 2002

-   Enders, Walter, *Applied econometric time series*. John Wiley & Sons, 2008

-   Hamilton, James D., *Time Series Analysis*, Princeton University Press, 2005

The level of these textbook goes from (relatively) easy (Brockwell and Davis) to difficult (Hamilton). The level of the class is probably in between the level of these two books. Enders' book has many applications of many time series concepts introduced during lectures.

I will provide handouts to highlight challenging aspects of a topic or present material not covered by the references. 

Other references and handout will be posted here!


Teams channel and class website 
===============================

The class has is own [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a4dd78435d16646d9b6fe8d18c37e3dcb%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=7af25703-eb1a-4d6f-9aee-341aef9e1121&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1). I will use it extensively for important communication.

The class has also a website [https://gragusa.org/macrotopics](https://gragusa.org/macrotopics). I will use it to host the course material.

Lecture 
=======

Due to the COVID-19 health emergency, the class will be remote with lectures streamed live using Zoom. Links to the lectures will be made available on the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a4dd78435d16646d9b6fe8d18c37e3dcb%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=7af25703-eb1a-4d6f-9aee-341aef9e1121&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1).

Software and Programming 
========================

The emphasis of the course is on methods and the analysis of real dataset. The best way to understand time series concepts is to write lots of code implementing the various techniques discussed in class on real macro e financial data. The computer language used in this course is [Julia](https://julialang.org).

Exams 
=====

The final grade depends on a series of homework assignments.
